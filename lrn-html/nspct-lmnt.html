      <p>The is a way to easily edit any site called inspect element<br>
      You can get to it by right clicking and then click inspect element or just inspect</p>
      <p>Somewhere on your screen a box will pop up. In that box there will be programming.<br>
      Right-click the first line and press edit html and then you can edit the page with the code you learned<br>
      I made a blank page so you dont have to bother deleting anything so you could open that and program on it.</p>
