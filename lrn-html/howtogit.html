    <p>First to make a github website you need to make an account so go <a href="https://github.com">here</a> to make an account.<br>
    Then after that make a new repository and name it yourusername.github.io and then you should make a index.html file after you have a readme.md.<br>
    After you do that you can start programming in the index.html file in html. Have Fun!</p>
